**Follow the Instructions**

-First we need to convert RGB to GRAY(color image to black and white image)
-In that case for extracting the text from the image. we can call it a transparent image for this one we have to increase the threshold value depending on your image and text quality. you can increase and decrease the value as you need.
-If our image size is imbalanced we can use the image cropping technique. 
- In transparent Images, we can add any color and white background as we need.
